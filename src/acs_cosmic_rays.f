c     
c     Read distribution of Cosmic rays as measured for ACS, which is
c     in Log(e-) of event versus the number of events per 1000 seconds per
c     WFC  (assumed as covering 202" x 202"). Since the file was
c     digitised from an STScI plot, it is heavily smoothed and then
c     converted into expected number of events per second per cm**2

c     The QE for ACS is ~ 75% if one would want to convert into equivalent
c     photon energy
