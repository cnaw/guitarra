c     Rather than make the linearity correction, do the inverse -
c     bias the counts !
c     Uses the linearity correction coefficients to create a look-up
c     table that is used to estimate what the observed counts would be.
c     If counts are above the level where the linearity correction is
c     valid, the observed counts get assigned the full well depth value
c
c     i, j    = pixel being used for the correction
c     eflux   = electron flux
c     inverse_correction = output convolved by the inverse linearity,
c                           converted into ADU
