Test run:
---------

To run a simple test and make sure some image gets written out, follow 
these steps:

After downloading the guitarra code and calibration data (see the
requirements file):

1. set the environment variables GUITARRA_HOME and GUITARRA_AUX
for bash (e.g. add to ~/.bashrc):

export GUITARRA_HOME=$HOME/guitarra/
export GUITARRA_AUX=$HOME/guitarra/data/

for csh, tcsh:
setenv GUITARRA_HOME $HOME/guitarra
setenv GUITARRA_AUX  $HOME/guitarra/data

2. create a "bin" directory under $GUITARRA_HOME 

3. create a "results" directory under $GUITARRA_HOME

If the "bin" and "results" directories are created elsewhere, you
will need to edit the makefiles in src and proselytism and the
perl/python scripts

4. Link the calibration data: 
ln -s /home/user/nircam/cal $GUITARRA_AUX/cal
where /home/user/nircam/cal is diretory where you downloaded the
NIRCam calibration data

5. go into the guitarra/src directory and edit the makefile
   to set the correct path for the cfitsio library:

For example:
libcfitsio = /usr/lib64/libcfitsio.so
# commented out:
#libcfitsio = /Users/sandrotacchella/ASTRO/Programms/cfitsio/lib/libcfitsio.a
# this is the correct path for this machine:
#libcfitsio=/home/cnaw/cfitsio/libcfitsio.a

6. Then got
cd $GUITARRA_HOME
make

Step 6 places the executables in this directory:
$GUITARRA_HOME/bin 

8. For a test run use the ./perl/play_pen.pl script

9. The play_pen.pl  script creates a batch file (named "batch"), which will
contain the inputs to  proselytism and guitarra .To run this batch type

source batch (tcsh)
or
/bin/sh batch (bash)




Occasionally (when something went wrong in a previous run), the
code will crash with this message:
-------------
 FITSIO Error Status =         105 : couldn't create the named file
 failed to create new file (already exists?):                                    
 /home/cnaw/test/guitarra/results/sim_cube_F200W_489_001.fits                    
 pause: enter return to continue
-------------

remove this file

rm /xxx/xxx/xxx/guitarra/results/sim_cube_F200W_489_001.fits

and re-run batch.
