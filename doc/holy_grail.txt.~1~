Guitarra itself will only use catalogue information such as positions,
Sersic parameters and the NIRCam filter to create a "scene", by adding
the detector footprints and what is known of the noise properties from
ground-based measurements obtained at the last cryogenic tests carried
out at Goddard Space Flight Center in 2015/2016.

Thus, much of the work to obtain a meaningful scene is carried out
prior to feeding parameters to guitarra - namely - creating the
input catalogue of sources.
