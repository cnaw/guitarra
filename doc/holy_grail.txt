Guitarra itself will only use catalogue information such as positions,
magnitudes, Sersic parameters and the NIRCam filter to create a
"scene", by adding the detector footprints and what is known of the
noise properties from ground-based measurements obtained at the last
cryogenic tests carried out at Goddard Space Flight Center in 2015/2016.

Thus, much of the work to obtain a meaningful scene is carried out
prior to feeding parameters to guitarra - namely - creating the
input catalogue of sources, the instrument setup (readout pattern,
number of groups) and survey strategy (JWST dither pattern). 

This is done by the perl script "write_jades_parameters.pl" which is
hard-coded for the JWST/GTO "compact" configuration in GOODS-S,
using output derived from the JWST APT file for observation 1180.
Th original APT file is available from STScI, but requires further
processing before it can be used by the guitarra scripts. For
instance, no data relative to coordinated parallel observations are
contained and in the case of NIRSpec/NIRCam parallels, the NIRCam
pointing centres, readout-pattern etc. have to be copied (manually of
course) from APT.
