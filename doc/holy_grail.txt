The first step carried out by guitarra is to read a parameter file
that identifies which SCA to simulate, the [RA,DEC] position of this SCA on
the sky, the filter, survey strategy (dither pattern, readout pattern,
number of groups) and noise sources to include.
This parameter file also contains the name of the input
catalogue, a file with the estimated zodiacal background and output
file name. This parameter file as well as the input catalogue are
prepared by the perl/python wrapper scripts.  

The procedure to input results from the APT files is not automated, 
and ultimately the scripts will have the ability to read the "xml" and
"pointing" outputs from the APT file by adding code developed at STScI
for mirage/apt (apt_inputs.py, read_apt_xml.py) by Bryan Hilbert and
others. This will allow recovering information on filter, exposure
parameters, orientation and dither patterns for NIRCam, either as the
prime or coordinated parallel instrument. 

Other wrapper scripts allow running several jobs in parallel (one per SCA, per
filter per position) and reducing the data using the University of
Arizona pipeline. Once mature versions of the STScI pipeline become
available, the output from guitarra will be updated to comply with the
format expected by the official pipeline.
