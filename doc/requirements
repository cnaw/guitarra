Guitarra requires the CFITSIO library, available from
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/

To run parallel jobs of guitarra (one per CPU) the following perl module is used:
https://metacpan.org/release/Parallel-ForkManager


If the ncdhas.pl script is used to reduce simulated raw images, the following perl wrapper library needs to be installed:

https://metacpan.org/pod/Astro::FITS::CFITSIO
